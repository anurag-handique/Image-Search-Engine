# Image-Search-Engine
## Description
This is a simple web-based Image Search Engine that allows users to search for images using keywords. It utilizes the Unsplash API to fetch and display images based on user queries. Additionally, the project includes a "Night mode" feature that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes for the interface.

## Features
- **Image Search**: Users can enter keywords in the search box and click "Search" to retrieve images related to their query.

- **Pagination**: The search results are paginated, and users can click the "Show more" button to load additional images.

- **Night Mode**: Users can switch between light and dark themes using the "Night mode" toggle switch.

- **Image Modal**: Clicking on an image in the search results opens a modal displaying a larger version of the image.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The project's structure and layout are created using HTML.

- **CSS**: Styling and design are achieved with CSS. A separate `style.css` file is linked to the HTML.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used for dynamic functionality, including handling user input, making API requests, and toggling night mode. The JavaScript code is contained in the `script.js` file.

- **Unsplash API**: The Unsplash API is used to fetch image data based on user queries. An API key is required for access.
